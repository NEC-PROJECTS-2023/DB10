### INTRODUCTION
In response to the highly competitive job market at present times, an increased
interest in graduate studies has arisen. This has not only burdened applicants but also led to
an increased workload on admission faculty members of universities. Any chance of
abridging the admission process impelled applicants and faculty workers to look for faster,
efficient, and more accurate methods for predicting admissions. The goal approach of this
paper is to implement and compare several supervised predictive analysis methods on a
labeled dataset based on real applications from the universities. Regression, classification,
and Ensemble methods are all the supervised methods that are to be employed for
prediction. The dataset relies profoundly on the academic performance of the applicants
during their undergrad years. The coefficient of determination, as well as precision and
accuracy, are the measures used to compare the different models.
All predictive methods proved to show accurate results, however; certain methods
proved to be more promising than others were. Predictions were obtained within short time
frames, which in turn will cut down the time in the admission process by the chance of getting
